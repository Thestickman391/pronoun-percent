 Twitter rate limits me to 15 requests for every 15 minutes. I could allow you to login with OAuth to get around this but to be honest, I doubt this would get popular enough to need that.
 
 The NPM package `get-twitter-followers` is included in this repo with a one line change to make it get twitter followed rather than followers.
